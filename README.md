    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the app in action.

## Code Overview

- The library array is loaded from `localStorage` or initialized as an empty array if not present.
- Book objects are created using a constructor function and stored in the library array.
- The library is saved to `localStorage` after any changes.
- The app allows users to add, update, and delete books in the library.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of object constructors and factory functions in JavaScript.
- Familiarity with localStorage for data persistence.
- Experience with DOM manipulation and event handling.
